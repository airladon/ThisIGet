Most of the time, the subForm name can be ignored.\n * However, it is useful when dealing with units. Sometimes you will have a\n * series of forms you want to animate through, that will be slightly different\n * depending on the units (for example degrees vs radians). Defining one subForm\n * as degrees, and a second as radians allows switching between subForms without\n * complicating the overall equation navigation logic.\n *\n * See the examples below for how to define subForms.\n *\n * {@link Equation#addForms}.\n *\n * @property {TypeEquationPhrase} content - the equation phrase of the form\n * defines how the elements are laid out\n * @property {number} [scale] - a scaling factor for this form\n * @property {TypeFormAlignment} [alignment] - how the Equation's position is aligned with\n * this form\n * @property {string} [subForm] -

form determines how elements are positioned relative to each other.\n  //\n  // A form of an equation takes the form's elements (a subset of the\n  // collection) and applies a translation and scale transformation. This\n  // aligns all the elements of a form relative to each other to render\n  // the desired form.\n  //\n  // Arranging a form of an equation goes through each element in the form\n  // and positions and scales it in the equation's vertex space.\n  // It also saves the locaiton and scale information in the form's element\n  // property.\n  //\n  // The elements are positioned relative to 0,0 in vertex space based on the\n  // fixTo, xAlign and yAlign parameters.\n  //\n  // fixTo can only be a point in the equation's vertex space, or a\n  // DiagramElement in the equation.\n  //\n  // If fixTo is an element in the equation:\n  //    - the fixTo element is positioned at 0, 0, and all other elements\n  //      repositioned relative to that.\n  //    - The equation collection setPosition (or translation transform) can\n  //      then be used to position the equation in the diagram (or relative\n  //      collection space)\n  //    -
