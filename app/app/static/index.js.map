diagram, there will be in hierarchy:\n//  - GL Canvas\n//    - Diagram\n//      - Element Collection\n//        - Element Primitive\n//          - Drawing Object (e.g. shape, text) from primative vertices\n//\n// A shape is defined in Drawing Object space.\n// It is then transformed by the element primative\n// It is then transformed by the element colleciton\n// It is then transformed by the diagram\n// it is then transformed into GL Space\n//\n// Diagram elements can also be rendered to an image in a HTML 2D canvas\n// element. To do so, pass in:\n//    - Diagram Element (primative or collection) to render\n//    - HTML element (which is a 2D canvas)\n//    - Window of diagram to render\n//    - Window scaling (how does the window fit within the HTML Element)\n//      - fit: diagram units will be scaled so that diagram window limits\n//             aspect ratio fits within the element aspect ratio\n//      - 1em: diagram units will be scaled so 0.2 diagram units (default font\n//             size) looks like 1em of the html element font size in pixels\n//      - 10px: diagram units will be scaled so that the max diagram window\n//              limit will be the pixel count\n//      - strech: diagram units will be scaled so that the diagram window\n//                limits will be stretched to fit the html element width\n//                and height\n// Then the process is:\n//    - html element size in pixels and aspect ratio found\n//    - html element size in gl coordinates found\n\nclass Diagram {\n
