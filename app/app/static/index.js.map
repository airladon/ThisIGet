Most of the time, the subForm name can be ignored.\n * However, it is useful when dealing with units. Sometimes you will have a\n * series of forms you want to animate through, that will be slightly different\n * depending on the units (for example degrees vs radians). Defining one subForm\n * as degrees, and a second as radians allows switching between subForms without\n * complicating the overall equation navigation logic.\n *\n * See the examples below for how to define subForms.\n *\n * {@link Equation#addForms}.\n *\n * @property {TypeEquationPhrase} content -

png.\n *\n * Textures can be used instead of colors to fill a shape in WebGL.\n *\n * Textures are effectively overlaid on a shape. Therefore, to overlay the\n * texture with the correct offset, magnification and aspect ratio the texture\n * must be mapped to the space the shape's vertices are defined in\n * (vertex space).\n *\n * This is done by defining a window, or rectangle, for the texture file\n * (`mapFrom`) and a similar window in vertex space (`mapTo`).\n * The texture is then offset and scaled such that its window aligns with the\n * vertex space window.\n *\n * The texture file has coordinates of (0, 0) in the bottom left corner and\n * (1, 1) in the top right corner.\n *\n * Therefore, to make a 1000 x 500 image fill a 2 x 1 rectangle in vertex space\n * centered at (0, 0) you would define:\n *\n * ```\n * mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)\n * mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)\n * ```\n *\n * If instead you wanted to zoom the image in the same rectange by a factor of 2\n * you could either:\n *\n * ```\n * mapFrom: new Rect(0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5)\n * mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)\n * ```\n *\n * or\n *\n * ```\n * mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)\n * mapTo: new Rect(-2, -1, 4, 2)\n * ```\n *\n * Two ways of doing this are provided as sometimes it is more convenient to\n * think about the window on the image, and other times the window in vertex\n * space.\n *\n * If the shape has fill outside the texture boundaries then either the\n * texture can be repeated, or a pixel from the border (edge) of the image is\n * used (called clamping to edge).\n * WebGL only allows images that are square with a side length that is a\n * power of 2 (such as 16, 32, 64, 128 etc) to be repeated. All other images\n * can only be clamped to their edge.\n *\n * To repeat all other image resolutions, a texture can be mapped to a rectangle\n * and then the rectangle repeated throughout the diagram.\n *\n * @property {string} src The url or location of the image\n * @property {Rect} [mapTo] vertex space window (`new Rect(-1, -1, 2, 2)`)\n * @property {Rect} [mapFrom] image space window (`new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)`)\n * @property {boolean} [repeat] `true` will tile the image. Only works with\n * images that are square whose number of side pixels is a power of 2 (`false`)\n * @property {() => void} [onLoad] textures are loaded asynchronously, so this\n * callback can be used to execute code after the texture is loaded.

It is defined\n * by a series of points which are the ends and corners of the polyline.\n *\n * The series of points is a zero width ideal polyline, and so to see it we must\n * give it some width. This width can either be grown on one side of the\n * ideal polyline or grown on both sides of it equally.\n *\n * Here we define a line's side as either the *positive* side, or *negative*\n * side. If a line is defined from p1 to p2, then the *positive* side is the\n * side where the line moves if it is rotated around p1 in the positive (counter\n * clockwise) direction. Thus the order of the points that define the line\n * defines which side is positive and negative. A polyline is made up of many\n * lines end to end, and thus itself will have a positive and negative side\n * dependent on the order of points.\n *\n * Each point, or line connection, creates a corner that will have an *inside*\n * angle (<180º) and an *outside* angle (>180º or reflex angle).\n *\n * Growing width on an outside corner can be challenging. As the corner becomes\n * sharper, the outside width joins at a point further and further from the\n * ideal corner. Eventually trucating the corner makes more visual sense\n * and therefore, a minimum angle (`minAutoCornerAngle`) is used to\n * specify when the corner should be drawn, and when it should be truncated.\n *\n *\n * @property {Array<TypeParsablePoint>} points\n * @property {number} [width] (`0.01`)\n * @property {boolean} [close] close the polyline on itself (`false`)\n * @property {'mid' | 'outside' | 'inside' | 'positive' | 'negative'} [widthIs]\n * defines how the width is grown from the polyline's points.\n * Only `\"mid\"` is fully compatible with all options in\n * `cornerStyle` and `dash`.
