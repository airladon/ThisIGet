annotation is an equation phrase ('annotation') which is laid out relative\n * to another equation phrase ('content'). For example:\n * <pre>\n *                  AAAA\n *                  AAAA\n *          CCCCCCCC\n *          CCCCCCCC\n *          CCCCCCCC\n *          CCCCCCCC\n * </pre>\n *\n * The options for defining how to annotate one equation phrase with another is\n * {@link EQN_Annotation}\n *\n * Content can also be annotated with a glyph (that itself may also be\n * annotated). The glyph can either encompass the content, or can be to the\n * top, bottom, left or right of the content\n *\n * <pre>\n *                         Top Glyph\n *                  GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG\n *                  GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG     Encompassing Glyph\n *                                            /\n *                                          /\n *        GGG       GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG        GGG\n *        GGG       GGG                 GGG        GGG\n *        GGG       GGG     CCCCCCC     GGG        GGG\n * Left   GGG       GGG     CCCCCCC     GGG        GGG   Right\n * Glyph  GGG       GGG     CCCCCCC     GGG        GGG   Glyph\n *        GGG       GGG                 GGG        GGG\n *        GGG       GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG        GGG\n *\n *\n *                  GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG\n *                  GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG\n *                       Bottom Glyph\n * </pre>\n * @property {TypeEquationPhrase} content\n * @property {EQN_Annotation} [annotation] use for just one annotation\n * @property {Array<EQN_Annotation>} [annotations] use for multiple annotations\n * @property {boolean} [inSize] `true` means resulting size includes\n * annotations (`true`)\n * @property {number} [space] extend resulting equation phrase size by space on\n * top, right, bottom and left sides (`0`)\n * @property {number} [topSpace] extend resulting equation phrase size by space\n * on top\n * @property {number} [bottomSpace] extend resulting equation phrase size by\n * space on bottom\n * @property {number} [leftSpace] extend resulting equation phrase size by space\n * on left\n * @property {number} [rightSpace] extend resulting equation phrase size by\n * space on right\n * @property {number} [contentScale] scale content (`1`)\n * @property {EQN_Glyphs} [glyphs] glyphs to annotate content with\n * @property {boolean} [fullContentBounds] use full bounds of content,\n * overriding any `inSize=false` properties in the content (`false`)\n * @property {boolean} [useFullBounds] make the bounds of this phrase equal to\n * the full bounds of the content even if `fullContentBounds=false` and the\n * brackets only surround a portion of the content (`false`)\n * @example\n * // Simple annotation\n *  annotate: {\n *    content: 'a',\n *    annotation: {\n *      content: 'b',\n *      yPosition: 'top',\n *      yAlign: 'bottom',\n *      xPosition: 'right',\n *      xAlign: 'left',\n *    },\n *  },\n *\n * @example\n * // Multiple Annotations\n *  annotate: {\n *    content: 'a',\n *    annotations: [\n *      {\n *        content: 'b',\n *        xPosition: 'right',\n *        yPosition: 'top',\n *        xAlign: 'left',\n *        yAlign: 'bottom',\n *      },\n *      {\n *        content: 'c',\n *        xPosition: 'right',\n *        yPosition: 'bottom',\n *        xAlign: 'left',\n *        yAlign: 'top',\n *      },\n *    ],\n *  },\n * @example\n * // left glyph with annotation\n * eqn.addElements([\n *   { bar: { symbol: 'bar', side: 'right' },\n * ])\n * eqn.addForms({\n *   form1: {\n *     annotate: {\n *       content: 'a',\n *       glyphs: {\n *         left:{\n *           symbol: 'bar',\n *           overhang: 0.1,\n *           annotation: {\n *             content: 'bbb',\n *             xPosition: 'right',\n *             yPosition: 'bottom',\n *             xAlign: 'left',\n *             yAlign: 'middle',\n *             scale: 0.5,\n *           },\n *         },\n *       },\n *     },\n *   },\n * });\n */\nexport type EQN_Annotate = {\n  content: TypeEquationPhrase,\n  annotation?: EQN_Annotation,\n  annotations?: Array<EQN_Annotation>,\n  fullContentBounds?: boolean,\n  useFullBounds?: boolean,\n  glyphs?: EQN_Glyphs,\n  inSize?: boolean,\n  space?: number,\n  topSpace?: number,\n  bottomSpace?: number,\n  leftSpace?: number,\n  rightSpace?: number,\n  contentScale?: number,\n};\n\n// There are lots of FlowFixMes in this file.

png.\n *\n * Textures can be used instead of colors to fill a shape in WebGL.\n *\n * Textures are effectively overlaid on a shape. Therefore, to overlay the\n * texture with the correct offset, magnification and aspect ratio the texture\n * must be mapped to the space the shape's vertices are defined in\n * (vertex space).\n *\n * This is done by defining a window, or rectangle, for the texture file\n * (`mapFrom`) and a similar window in vertex space (`mapTo`).\n * The texture is then offset and scaled such that its window aligns with the\n * vertex space window.\n *\n * The texture file has coordinates of (0, 0) in the bottom left corner and\n * (1, 1) in the top right corner.\n *\n * Therefore, to make a 1000 x 500 image fill a 2 x 1 rectangle in vertex space\n * centered at (0, 0) you would define:\n *\n * ```\n * mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)\n * mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)\n * ```\n *\n * If instead you wanted to zoom the image in the same rectange by a factor of 2\n * you could either:\n *\n * ```\n * mapFrom: new Rect(0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5)\n * mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)\n * ```\n *\n * or\n *\n * ```\n * mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)\n * mapTo: new Rect(-2, -1, 4, 2)\n * ```\n *\n * Two ways of doing this are provided as sometimes it is more convenient to\n * think about the window on the image, and other times the window in vertex\n * space.\n *\n * If the shape has fill outside the texture boundaries then either the\n * texture can be repeated, or a pixel from the border (edge) of the image is\n * used (called clamping to edge).\n * WebGL only allows images that are square with a side length that is a\n * power of 2 (such as 16, 32, 64, 128 etc) to be repeated. All other images\n * can only be clamped to their edge.\n *\n * To repeat all other image resolutions, a texture can be mapped to a rectangle\n * and then the rectangle repeated throughout the diagram.\n *\n * @property {string} src The url or location of the image\n * @property {Rect} [mapTo] vertex space window (`new Rect(-1, -1, 2, 2)`)\n * @property {Rect} [mapFrom] image space window (`new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)`)\n * @property {boolean} [repeat] `true` will tile the image.

It is defined\n * by a series of points which are the ends and corners of the polyline.\n *\n * The series of points is a zero width ideal polyline, and so to see it we must\n * give it some width. This width can either be grown on one side of the\n * ideal polyline or grown on both sides of it equally.\n *\n * Here we define a line's side as either the *positive* side, or *negative*\n * side. If a line is defined from p1 to p2, then the *positive* side is the\n * side where the line moves if it is rotated around p1 in the positive (counter\n * clockwise) direction. Thus the order of the points that define the line\n * defines which side is positive and negative. A polyline is made up of many\n * lines end to end, and thus itself will have a positive and negative side\n * dependent on the order of points.\n *\n * Each point, or line connection, creates a corner that will have an *inside*\n * angle (<180º) and an *outside* angle (>180º or reflex angle).\n *\n * Growing width on an outside corner can be challenging. As the corner becomes\n * sharper, the outside width joins at a point further and further from the\n * ideal corner. Eventually trucating the corner makes more visual sense\n * and therefore, a minimum angle (`minAutoCornerAngle`) is used to\n * specify when the corner should be drawn, and when it should be truncated.\n *\n *\n * @property {Array<TypeParsablePoint>} points\n * @property {number} [width] (`0.01`)\n * @property {boolean} [close] close the polyline on itself (`false`)\n * @property {'mid' | 'outside' | 'inside' | 'positive' | 'negative'} [widthIs]\n * defines how the width is grown from the polyline's points.\n * Only `\"mid\"` is fully compatible with all options in\n * `cornerStyle` and `dash`.
