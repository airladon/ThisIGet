This is not perfect, but\n// haven't been able to come up with a quick work around. The problem statement\n// is each function can accept as arguements either a full object definition\n// or the definition split over parameters.\n// The problem is then the first arguement can be so many types, some of which\n// are subsets of the other, then when its parameters are extracted, their type\n// is all confused.\nexport class EquationFunctions {\n  // eslint-disable-next-line
