# About This I Get

<html><div class=information__subtitle>Who created this site and why?</div></html>

<!-- ## Hello and Thank You! -->
Thank you for visiting this site, and I hope you get something positive out of it!

My name is Rob and I initially created this site as an excuse to learn more about software and web technologies (I am an electrical engineer, and don’t have a deep skill set in either), while at the same time pursuing an interest in experimenting with interactive educational content.

During its development, I started to believe that making a concept available in a number of different versions might be useful. Often when learning something new, I have to read or watch the same concept from several different sources to make me comfortable with it. Therefore, making different versions of the same concept available to a user may be more convenient for them as well.

As an extension, I think that if users can rate the different versions then it is even more useful. In the short term users may increase their learning efficiency by trying the more popular versions first, and in the long term they may be able to get personalized suggestions on which versions to try first based on their previous ratings and those of the population.

This site is not aimed at a particular audience or age group. It is simply reference material that people may, or may not, find useful. It is a constant work in progress and I invite anyone that wants to [contribute](/contact) to do so!

## Credits

This site was created with the help of many open source projects. Open source projects are core to many web technologies, and without them web the variety of high quality websites you see today would not exist. Many open source projects are developed by people in their spare time.

In developing this website, a Javscript library that helps make interactive diagrams (including equations) easy to create and animate was developed and open sourced. It is named [FigureOne](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne).

A list of some of the third party open source projects that are used to develop and run this site are listed below. The list is not in any particular order, and does not necessarily include all the open source projects these projects themselves rely on.
